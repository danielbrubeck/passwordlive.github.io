            <span class="question"><b>Q: I still don't understand how to use it.</b></span><br />
            <span class="answer">A: Just try to do the following:</span>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Type '<span>secretkey123</span>' into the 'secret keyword' area.</li>
            <li>Type '<span>gmail</span>' into the 'What for?' area.</li>
            <li>Press 'Generate Password' and you will see your password for gmail.</li>
            <li>Now change '<span>gmail</span>' to '<span>amazon</span>' and press 'Generate Password' again. You will see the new password for amazon.</li>
            <li>If you change '<span>amazon</span>' back to '<span>gmail</span>' again, you will see the very same password you did previously! It means that you only have to remember that one secret keyword to have access to all your passwords.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <span class="question"><b>Q: Do you store any information on the server?</b></span><br />
            <span class="answer">A: Absolutely not! Results are calculated "on the fly" in your browser. Password Live does not store any information.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="question"><b>Q: Is it safe to use?</b></span><br />
            <span class="answer">A: Password Live is based on the Secure Hash Algorithm which makes reverse-engineering your keywords virtually impossible. However, it is obviously advised to use a keyword that is reasonably hard to guess!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="question"><b>Q: Why have you created Password Live?</b></span><br />
            <span class="answer">A: We needed a good password generator and we didn't like the existing ones. If you really want your passwords to be safe, you will not store them permanently anywhere! That is the reason Password Live was created.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="question"><b>Q: Where can I find more information about the algorithm being used?</b></span><br />
            <span class="answer">A: Please check Wikipedia at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2</a>. Password live uses the SHA-256 variant. You can also view the entire algorithm on <a href="https://github.com/passwordlive/passwordlive.github.io/tree/master/Scripts/PasswordLive">GitHub</a>.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="question"><b>Q: Is Password Live free?</b></span><br />
            <span class="answer">A: Yes, and forever will be!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="question"><b>Q: There is no Password Live for mobile!</b></span><br />
            <span class="answer">A: Please note that you can access the Password Live website directly from a mobile browser. The website is mobile-friendly, so in reality that's all you should need to access your passwords anytime :-)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="question"><b>Q: I've forgotten my keyword!</b></span><br />
            <span class="answer">A: Unfortunately it's absolutely impossible to recover any data.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="question"><b>Q: I'd like to ask something else not mentioned here.</b></span><br />
            <span class="answer">A: Please feel free to open up an issue on the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/passwordlive/passwordlive.github.io/issues">issue tracker</a> and we will do our best to help you out.</span>
